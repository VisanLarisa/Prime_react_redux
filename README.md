# Prime_react_redux
This is a simple web application, with a REST-ful backend which accesses data stored in a SQLite relational database. The backend is linked to a React SPA frontend (designed using PrimeReact).
The application organises a list of Articles and their References ("has a" relationship), performing GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations.
